# Cancel pending demo close order

> **Rate limit:** 20 requests per 60 seconds. This is a **shared quota** — the same budget is consumed by a group of related endpoints, so calling any of them reduces what is left for the others (you cannot call each at the full rate independently). Endpoints sharing this quota:
- `DELETE /api/v1/trading/execution/demo/limit-orders/{orderId}`
- `DELETE /api/v1/trading/execution/demo/market-open-orders/{orderId}`
- `DELETE /api/v2/trading/execution/demo/orders/{orderId}`
- `POST /api/v1/trading/execution/demo/limit-orders`
- `POST /api/v1/trading/execution/demo/market-close-orders/positions/{positionId}`
- `POST /api/v1/trading/execution/demo/market-open-orders/by-amount`
- `POST /api/v1/trading/execution/demo/market-open-orders/by-units`
- `POST /api/v2/trading/execution/demo/orders`

---

This endpoint allows traders to cancel a previously placed market order for close before execution. If the order has already been processed, cancellation will not be possible.
